## Description of the Game
There are 6 cards in total in the game and each card has its own properties. 3 of these cards are locked at the beginning of the game. They are unlocked according to your team's level score in the later stages of the game. These features are hitting advantage, durability, hitting power. The user can view these features by pressing the "Card Information" button on the home screen of the game.
When the user presses the Start Game button, the game asks the user to enter a number of rounds and the game starts. At the beginning of the game, 6 cards are randomly assigned to the user and the opposite computer, and the player cannot see the cards of the opposite computer.
When the round starts, the user is expected to choose 3 of the cards in her/his hand and press the "Complete Selection" Button. The round is played and the players' chosen cards are pitted against the computer's chosen cards. There may be cards whose durability has decreased or expired as a result of the battle.
Cards whose durability is exhausted are removed from the deck. Each card has its own level point, and you gain the level point of the card you kill for your team. If your team passes a certain level score, the 3 card types that were initially locked will be unlocked and so a random card added each round can be one of the 3 cards unlocked.
At the end of the round, each side is given 1 random card. Cards played each round can be viewed from the "Tour History" tab in the middle.When a new round begins, the user is asked to choose cards different from the cards he/she selected in the previous round. When the number of rounds is completed or when either side has no cards left, the game ends and the winner is determined.
